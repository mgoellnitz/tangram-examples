Tangram Ebean Example
================

Very small tangram example application using the EBean ORM module.

To wire up the application you can either use the springframework or dinistiq.

As the security frameworks for the login - which should at least be active for the 
editing part of the application which is included with this example - you have the 
options of Apache Shiro and Spring Security.

Th example is pre-configured to use an h2 database local to your development directory.
