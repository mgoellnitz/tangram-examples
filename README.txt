These are the example applications for the different usage flavours of tangram.

They are also meant as a starting point for your own projects.

When you managed to build tangram, a 

gradle build

in this directory should do the job. Except the Google App Engine one, all examples
can be started via

gradle jettyRunWar

and are running as a default on port 12380 - unless you changed that. They don't 
depend on anygthing else running on your system than tangram itself.
